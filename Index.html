    <h1> About </h1>
    <h3> I like to play the piano because it makes me relaxed now I will tell you more about the piano.The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Italy. Cristofori was unsatisfied by the lack of control that musicians had over the volume level of the harpsichord. He is credited for switching out the plucking mechanism with a hammer to create the modern piano in around the year 1700. </h3>
